    'I am a third-year IT student at Politechnika Łódzka who enjoys developing software and designing something that looks good, I was a graphic designer for few years and I really liked it. One day, I was introduced to React, and since then, I have gained one year of commercial experience as a frontend developer. I am eager to continue learning and expanding my skills, including those not directly related to frontend development, as my ultimate goal is to become a full-stack developer someday.'
